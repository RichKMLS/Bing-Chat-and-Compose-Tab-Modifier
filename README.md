# Bing-Chat-and-Compose-Tab-Modifier

New!

Since user-scripts are seemingly blocked on edgeservices&period;bing&period;com/edgesvc/*, <br>
Here is an overkill solution that uses image recognition
to automate the process of    

- Opening Edge Dev Browser
- Opening the Discover side bar and loading the Chat and Compose interface
- Closing the Discover side bar
- Opening a Bing chat tab and a Compose tab in Edge Dev
- Opening the Developer Console
- Running JavaScript in the Developer Console to modify the behavior of the tabs
- Closing the Developer Console

todo:
- linux version using firejail

## Features and Limitations

- The script currently makes some assumptions about how Edge Dev Browser is set up such as using a Dark theme.
